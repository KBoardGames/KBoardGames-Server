-----------------------------------------------------------------


ConsoleNoClose disables the X button and removes the Close system
menu item of all console windows when they become active.

It runs invisible in the background.

If it's started when another instance is running, it ends and
leaves the previous instance untouched.

To remove a previous instance from memory, run it with parameter /R
or /RH (hidden, no messagebox).


To do it for exactely one console window, start it with parameter /1.
It will then disable the X button of the first console window that
becomes active. Then it ends.


Started with /ALL it deactivates all menus of console windows. They
cannot be closed, maximized, minimized then. No access to settings
anymore.


With Fast User Switching it works within the same session only.


Under Vista and Windows 7 it must run elevated ("As Administrator")
to do it with evlevated console windows.
